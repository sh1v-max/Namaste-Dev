# Namaste DSA

This repository contains structured notes and JavaScript implementations based on the **Namaste DSA** course by Akshay Saini.

The objective is to build a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms through conceptual clarity, hands-on coding, and consistent practice — starting from basics and gradually progressing toward more advanced topics.


## About the Course

* **Instructor:** Akshay Saini
* [Watch here](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-dsa)

The course is known for its beginner-friendly explanations and strong emphasis on problem-solving, recursion fundamentals, memory models, and core DSA concepts.


## Learning Goals

* Understand core DSA topics with depth and clarity
* Strengthen problem-solving and debugging skills using JavaScript
* Learn to write clean, efficient, and readable code
* Practice approaching problems methodically: from brute force to optimal
* Build long-term recall of logic and implementation patterns


## Topics Covered (So Far)

* ✅ Introduction to DSA
* ✅ Recursion & Call Stack
* ✅ Time and Space Complexity
* ✅ Arrays – traversal, search, edge cases
* ✅ Strings – manipulation, frequency maps, comparison logic
* ✅ Linked Lists – implementation and operations

> The list will be updated as the course progresses.


## Practice Approach

* Implement all discussed concepts in plain JavaScript
* Solve related problems alongside each topic
* Maintain clear function structures with proper naming and comments
* Track edge cases, dry runs, and complexity analysis
* Write self-contained code for readability and testing



## Tech Stack

* Language: **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* Environment: Node.js or browser console (no frameworks used)
